Only 2 in 3 Italians voted in 2022 — the lowest turnout in decades. Meanwhile, Italy's Parliament looks nothing like the country it represents.

Women make up 51% of the population but hold just 36% of parliamentary seats. Nearly a quarter of Italians are under 35, yet they occupy only 3% of Parliament. And while just 22% of citizens hold university degrees, 78% of MPs do, most from wealthy families who could afford law school.

&nbsp;  
This isn't just about fairness. It's about democracy itself.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
When entire groups lack representation, they lose their voice in the laws that govern them. Political scientists call this _descriptive representation_, that is the idea that shared backgrounds help representatives understand and advocate for their constituents' interests.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Italy's Parliament consists of 605 members across two chambers, elected every five years. But as voter turnout plummets and trust in institutions erodes, a critical question emerges: Can a democracy survive when its representatives don't reflect the people they serve?
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
The numbers tell a stark story. Across four key demographics — gender, age, education, and regional origin — massive gaps separate Parliament from the population. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Even more troubling: millions of Italians have no representation at all. Around 9% of residents lack citizenship despite living, working, and paying taxes in Italy for years. Many of their children were born here, yet none can vote for the lawmakers whose rules they must follow.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Meanwhile, 16.6 million registered voters — more than one-third of the electorate — have given up entirely, staying home on election day.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
If Italian democracy is to survive, it must bridge these gaps. The question is whether it's already too late.
