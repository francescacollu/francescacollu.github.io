There are also two last groups of people in the Italian society that, without a doubt, have no representatives - simply because they never had the chance to choose them. They lack all forms of representation, having never given their authorization or meaning, either formally or symbolically.

The first group could not do it; the second chose not to.

In Italy, around 9% of residents do not hold citizenship. These are people who have lived in Italy for years, paied taxes, and - among them - about one million children were even born here and went to Italian schools. Yet, they do not get to choose the lawmakers whose rules they must follow. While citizenship remains the formal requirement for election to Parliament, it is worth questioning how well this criterion reflects the actual composition of Italian society today — a society in which millions of residents, many with long-standing lives in Italy, remain excluded from political representation.

The second group is made up of people who no longer recognize the two pillars of formal representation: authorization and accountability. This group includes more than one third of the electorate: 36.1% of registered voters, around 16.6 million people, who, every time they are called to choose their representatives in Parliament, reject the call. And their numbers keep growing.

Would the gap between the Italian Parliament and the population it claims to represent — already wide in terms of gender, age, education (and therefore class), and origin — shrink if these two excluded groups were part of the picture?
