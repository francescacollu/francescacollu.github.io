Beyond the gaps in gender, age, education, and geography lies an even starker reality: millions of Italians have no representation at all.

Two groups are completely locked out of Italy's democracy: one by law, one by choice.

**The Disenfranchised**

Around 9% of Italy's residents — 5.4 million people — cannot vote. They lack citizenship despite living, working, and paying taxes here for years. Among them are one million children born on Italian soil, educated in Italian schools, yet barred from choosing the lawmakers whose rules govern their lives.

**The Disenchanted**

The second group chose exclusion. They no longer recognize the two pillars of formal representation: authorization and accountability.

This includes 36.1% of registered voters — around 16.6 million people — who, every election cycle, reject the call to choose their representatives. And their numbers keep growing.

These citizens have withdrawn their consent from a system they see as fundamentally disconnected from their lives and interests.

**The Ultimate Question**

Would the representation gap — already wide across gender, age, education, and origin — shrink if these two excluded groups were part of the picture?

What would Italian democracy look like if the 22 million disenfranchised and disenchanted could participate? Would a Parliament that included non-citizen residents and re-engaged the politically abandoned finally bridge the gap between representatives and represented?

Or has the disconnect grown so vast that even including these voices couldn't restore faith in Italian democracy?

The answer will determine whether Italy remains a true representative democracy — or becomes a government of elites ruling over an increasingly alienated population.
