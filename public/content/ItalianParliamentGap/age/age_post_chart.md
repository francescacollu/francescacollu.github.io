The numbers are stark: Italians under 35 make up a third of the electorate but hold just 1% of parliamentary seats. While other democracies debate lowering voting ages, Italy maintains some of Europe's highest barriers to candidacy.

The rules seem designed to exclude youth. Want to run for the Chamber of Deputies? You must be 25. The Senate? A staggering 40 years old, meaning millions of Italian voters can't even dream of representing their peers until middle age.

Youth itself has no intrinsic value. While it is reasonable that most of the legislators are adults with a certain level of experience, it is odd that a third of Italian society, who have the right to vote, do not have the right to access the highest level of political representation. 

Other countries are moving in the opposite direction. Austria, Scotland, and several German states have lowered candidate ages. Some allow 16-year-olds to vote. Italy, meanwhile, clings to rules written when life expectancy was decades shorter.

The irony is crushing: Italy's youth exodus — with hundreds of thousands emigrating annually — is partly driven by policies written by a generation that will never live with the consequences.

Democracy requires that those who must live with decisions have a say in making them. By excluding its youngest citizens from power, Italy is writing its own decline.
