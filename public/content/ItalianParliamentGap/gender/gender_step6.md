With regard to people who do not identify as either men or women, there have not been any non-binary representatives in the Italian Parliament to date. However, in 2006, the first trans person was elected to the Italian Parliament - and also became the first trans person elected to any European parliament. Her name is Vladimir Luxuria. She spearheaded several legislative initiatives, including a bill on the rights and freedoms of trans people - an example of descriptive and substantive representation working in tandem.
