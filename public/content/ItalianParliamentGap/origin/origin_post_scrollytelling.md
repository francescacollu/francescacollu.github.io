**What about Italy's borders?**

Italy is a country transformed by migration. Once a nation of emigrants, it's now a key destination for migrants, making immigration one of its most explosive political issues. Every year, hundreds die crossing the Mediterranean, yet legislators consistently fail to craft effective, humane solutions.

The electoral system does reserve 12 parliamentary seats for Italians living abroad, spread across continents from Europe to Antarctica. But what about the millions living in Italy who come from migrant backgrounds?

Here's where representation gets truly complex. Consider Toni Iwobi, Italy's first Black senator. Born in Nigeria, he was elected on the Lega party ticket, the same party that built its brand on anti-immigration rhetoric. His presence proves that descriptive representation doesn't automatically translate to advocacy for one's community.
