The Italian Parliament is made by two chambers and 605 members, among which we count deputies and senators. Italian voters choose them through elections, nominally every 5 years.

This process happens because Italy is a republic with a so-called _representative democracy_, which means that citizens elect people that can represent themselves in an assembly, which in the case of Italy is called Parliament.

The representation issue may seem trivial, but it's instead a subtle issue to address. In fact, Hanna Pitkin's influential work led to the identification of four views of representation: formalistic, symbolic, descriptive and substantive. The _formalistic representation_ is the one estabilished by the institutional mechanism, basing on authorization and accountability. The _symbolic representation_ pertains the meanining and significance that representatives hold for their constituents. Its legitimacy is based on the recognition by the constituents. The _descriptive representation_ lies on the idea that sharing demographic characteristics can lead to better understanding and advocacy for specific groups' interests. The _substantive representation_ focuses on the actions taken by representatives on behalf of their consituents, emphasizing on the outcomes of representation over mere resemblance or formal processes. 

Currently, in Italy the first two views are fairly present, although disillusionment towards politics is growing, as evidenced by the fact that more and more citizens are deserting the ballot box during elections (during 2022 elections, just 64% of the citizens voted). How are the other two kinds of representation doing? Not great. The substantive representation is for sure the most important one, since 


Before we start to investigate to search an answer for this question, let's deal with the issue that arises with it: does representativeness give some warranty of care and determination for bringing to the highest legislative institution issues that tipically belong to certain groups of people? The subject is subtle, if not misleading. In 1978, a Parliament with less than 7% of women, passed a fundamental law on abortion. 


Let's focus on four groups of people.
