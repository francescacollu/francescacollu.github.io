The Italian Parliament consists of two chambers and 605 members, including deputies and senators. Italian voters elect them through elections every five years.

This process occurs because Italy is a republic with a _representative democracy_, meaning citizens elect representatives to serve in an assembly. In Italy, this assembly is called Parliament.

The representation issue may seem trivial, but it is actually a subtle issue to address. In fact, Hanna Pitkin's influential work[REF] led to the identification of four views of representation: formalistic, symbolic, descriptive and substantive. _Formalistic representation_ is established by institutional mechanisms based on authorization and accountability. _Symbolic representation_ pertains to the meanining and significance that representatives hold for their constituents. Its legitimacy is based on recognition by constituents. _Descriptive representation_ is based on the idea that sharing demographic characteristics can lead to a better understanding of, and advocacy for, specific groups' interests. _Substantive representation_ focuses on the actions representatives take on behalf of their consituents, emphasizing on the outcomes of representation over mere resemblance or formal processes. 

Currently, the first two views are fairly prevalent in Italy, although disillusionment toward politics is growing. More and more citizens are staying home on election day, as evidenced by the fact that only 64% of citizens voted in the 2022 elections. How are the other two types of representation faring? Substantive representation is certainly essential since it focuses on practical results and the representatives acting in the interests of the represented, such as new laws and financing. Is this related to descriptive representation? Pitkin herself is skeptical because looking like the group does not guarantee acting in its interests. Later in the discussion, evidence will be presented to support this observation. Conversely, a person can advocate for another even if they do not belong to the same demographic group. For example, in 1978, the Italian parliament, which had fewer than 7% women, passed a fundamental law on abortion. However, we do not know if a greater female presence would have led to its passage before 1978 (later than most European countries). Several political scientists[REF] argue that _presence_ matters in deliberative settings because it affects what is discussed and how perspectives are received.

Yet, entire portions of the population are not properly represented in the Italian Parliament. Often, this means they lack a voice, which could lead to a lower level of recognition and sense of legitimacy, thus undermining the symbolic representation.

If the Italian Parliament truly wants to represent society, then it must address this issue. It should bridge the gap.
