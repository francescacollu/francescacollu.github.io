The Italian Parliament is made by two chambers and 605 members, among which we count deputies and senators. Italian voters choose them through elections, nominally every 5 years.

This process happens because Italy is a republic with a so-called representative democracy, which means that citizens elect people that can represent themselves in an assembly, which in the case under scrutiny is called Parliament. 

Said in such simplicistic and concise way, one could also expect that such members of the Parliament would effectively represent the citizens, or said in another way: one could expect that citizens would choose people that effectively represent them. But does it actually go this way? 

Before we start to investigate to search an answer for this question, let's deal with the issue that arises with it: does representativeness give some warranty of care and determination for bringing to the highest legislative institution issues that tipically belong to certain groups of people? The subject is subtle, if not misleading. In 1978, a Parliament with less than 7% of women, passed a fundamental law on abortion.
